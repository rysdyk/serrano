        this method might also return a 404 if the job completed in the past
        but the result has been culled because the result expired or was
        replaced such as is the case in some in-memory storage systems. This
        method makes no assumption of that as the job management is handled
        by Avocado and this method should be independent of the async system
        used for creating and running jobs.
