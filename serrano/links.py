def reverse_tmpl(uri, name, params):
    """
    Returns an unquoted uri containing the reverse name with param replacement.

    This methods does a number of things. If there were no params, all that
    would happend would be that the name would be reversed, that reversed
    name would be passed to the supplied uri method, and that unquoted uri
    would be returned. When params are present, we will modify the reversed
    name.

    Params should be a dictionary in the following form:

        {
            url_param: (type, alias),
            ...
        }

    So, let's consider the url for retrieving a single view:

        url(r'^(?P<pk>\d+)/$', single_resource, name='single')

    Then we would constructs params as:

        {
            'pk': (int, 'id')
        }

    Which instructs this method that the pk url param is an integer and should
    be replaced in the final uri with `{id}`. The types supported by this
    method are:

        (complex, float, int, long, str)

    Which should cover all the cases we could possibly see in the URL. Also,
    these happen to be all the cases we can safely convert an int to. This is
    important because we use integers as placeholders when reversing the URL
    and then we replace those integers with the aliases after all the
    reversals are done. As noted below, this has the limitation of only
    supporting 10 params. The reason for this limitation is in the replacement.
    Let's say we had 11 params then the 11th param would take the placeholder
    10. When we go to replace, we might try to replace 0 and 1 before 10 which
    means that the 1 and 0 in 10 might be replaced before 10 itself is replaced
    which would obviously return a malformed uri. This is acceptable in our
    case as we don't have any urls with more than 2 params so until there is
    a strong use case for supporting 11+ url params, this should suffice.

    The unquoting occurs becuase we don't want %7B and %7D for { and }
    respectively in the returned url. This will occur because the replacement
    is occuring before the call to uri which will quote those characters. If
    for nothing else, this increases readability of the URLs and makes the
    URLs consistent for the client.
